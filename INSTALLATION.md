## Software Stack

VotePen is a Laravel application that runs on the following software:

- Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
- Nginx 1.10+
- MySQL 5.7+ (to use mariaDB, you must modify `json` type migration columns to `blob` by running `sed -i 's/json(/binary(/g' *` inside the database/migrations/ directory in Linux)
- PHP 7.1+
- Redis 3.0+
- Git 2.8.4+
- [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) (votepen.com uses [laravel-echo-server](https://github.com/tlaverdure/laravel-echo-server) on production server)
- [Algolia Search](https://www.algolia.com/referrals/fb684d54/join/)

To install all the required stack on a server, we recommend an auto-installation service such as [CodePier](https://codepier.io/?ref=votepen).

### Supervisor Steps

#### Installing Supervisor

Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system, and will automatically restart your queue:work process if it fails. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command:

`sudo apt-get install supervisor`

#### Configuring Supervisor

Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored.

Copy the files from `supervisor` to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d`

#### Starting Supervisor
Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the processes using the following commands:

```
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start votepen-worker:*
sudo supervisorctl start horizon:*
```

### Create admin user

To create an admin user, run the below command from the root of the project

```
php artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder
```

The login details for the admin user is `admin` and `password`.

After running the seeder, be sure to clear your redis cache, you should now be able to navigate to `/backend`
