## I want to report a problem or ask a question

Before submitting a new GitLab issue, please make sure to

- Check out the README pages on [this repo](https://gitlab.com/VotePen/Platform)
- Search for [existing GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/VotePen/Platform/issues)

If the above doesn't help, please [submit an issue](https://gitlab.com/VotePen/Platform/issues) on GitLab and provide information about your setup.

**Note**: If you want to report a regression in _VotePen_ (something that has worked before, but broke with a new release), please mark your issue title as such using `[Regression] Your title here`. This enables us to quickly detect and fix regressions.

Some people might also use the [_VotePen_ tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/votepen), however we donâ€™t actively monitor issues submitted there.
